Some basic machine learning algorithms implemented in R, as partial requirements of Introduction to Machine Learning course offered in Ko√ß University.

The implementations have very nice visualizations. I suggest that you take a look if you are interested.

Includes:

1. Multivariate Parametric Classification
2. Multiclass Linear Discrimination
3. Multiclass Multilayer Perceptron
4. Nonparametric Regression
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Linear Discriminant Analysis
7. Expectation Maximization Clustering
